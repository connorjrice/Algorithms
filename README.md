Algorithms
=======

Various algorithms, including sorting and search algorithms.

A description of some of the algorithms can be found in "labbook.xls", this document also contains analysis of algorithmic complexity and various running times. This document does not include all of the algorithms that are implemented, but it goes into some discussion on the sorting algorithms as well as a few of the graph algorithms.

Otherwise, code is located under the src/ directory. The packages are broken up by algorithm type, such as "sorting" and "graph". 

Another area of interest is the test directory, which includes unit tests for a number of the sorting algorithms, written in JUnit.
